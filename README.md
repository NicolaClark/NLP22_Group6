If heatmaps are wanted please run that part too. <br>

Please download embeddings from http://itu.dk/~robv/data/embeds/GoogleNews-50k.bin.tar.gz , unzip it, and place the file in the data folder, in order for the notebook to run correctly.<br>


If tracking of the models is wanted please install MLFlow and un-out-comment the given lines in MLFlow. <br>
