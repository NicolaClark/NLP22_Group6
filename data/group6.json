{"reviewText": "\"Rainbow\" was a hard album for me to reiew. I love JohnnyC ash, and to give anything thate h has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cashs' last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this tmie around. Chips Moman had produced osme incedble R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" Howveer, ths pairing dosn't work as well . The material is weak and some quite llu-sited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries tor late to being a illioaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Lov Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as boreds inging it as I did listening to it. Sad. Teh albu has three eral good moments though. The opener \"Im' Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferon's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifitng sory told well. Cash's cover of CCR's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" standsout also.

Battlefield 2 and Bad Company being the most prominent,t he sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is amaznig.\n\nThe reason ofr 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very oddsection of ercussion only, about halfway through the nog. It oges on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were trying to do I then figured that it was probably their attempt at th eBattlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no, it'snot.

People get theirf ixes from difefrent places.  Okay.

I am not an nime fanati,c nor do  fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall hlplessly in love with it, or I just plain find it boing as hell.  I realyl don't want to degrade th eplayer on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, epseciall when you are in a stdio and you are aware of all your mistkaes. This playe ris good, plays all the right notes.  I ssupect that they person might even be sight reading ll of these pieces, which is a talent t be sure.  Unfortunately the playin cmes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some rea lgems on this ablum.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase pricesimply because of the sng from Totoro called \"Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Pah.\"  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except heer, isa bsolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged thisi s simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of te original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melod very simpl. The introductory repetitive left and passagekeeps the piece moving giving it an undercrurent of logning, sadness, or maybe jst expressign the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and th ewind?  I don't know, bu tit reminsd me of whata progressive rock keyboardist might do with it lik eKeith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme form Totoro is cute, butI  beleve it would sound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the ahppy qualities that it should be played with, and again, vry mechanical.
